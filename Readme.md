Rubik's Cube Solver (JavaScript)
A fully interactive Rubik's Cube solver built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project provides a complete simulation of a 3x3 Rubik’s Cube with scramble, solve, and manual rotation features — all visualized in a colorful and user-friendly interface.
🔗 Live Demo: 
✨ Features
🎲 Scramble Functionality – Randomizes the cube using valid moves
🧠 Solve Mode – Solves the cube using reverse logic of scramble steps
🖐️ Manual Rotation Controls – Rotate any face manually
👁️ Step-by-Step Visuals – Shows cube state after each move
📝 Algorithm Viewer – Lists all moves used in scramble and solve
🔄 Reset Button – Instantly restores cube to solved state
🛑 Notification – Alerts user when cube is already solved
🎨 Colorful, Responsive UI – Fixed top/bottom layout, gradient background
📦 Pure Frontend – No external libraries or frameworks used
🚀 How to Use
Clone/download this repository.
Open index.html in any modern browser.
Use the top buttons to:
   - Scramble the cube
   - Solve it step-by-step
   - Reset to the original solved state
Use the bottom manual controls to rotate individual sides of the cube.
